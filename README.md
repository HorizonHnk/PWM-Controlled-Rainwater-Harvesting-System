Project Summary
This project implements an intelligent rainwater collection and distribution system using pulse-width modulation (PWM) to optimize water usage. By precisely controlling pump operations, the system ensures efficient water utilization while maintaining collection capacity during rainfall events.
System Highlights

555 timer-based PWM control: Precision pump speed regulation
Adaptive distribution: Water flow based on collection levels
Energy-efficient operation: 40-60% power reduction vs. constant-speed pumps
Low-cost implementation: Uses readily available components
Scalable design: Suitable for residential to community applications
