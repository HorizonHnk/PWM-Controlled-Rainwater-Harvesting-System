# PWM-Controlled Rainwater Harvesting System
> Sustainable water conservation through precision motor control

## Project Summary
This project implements an intelligent rainwater collection and distribution system using pulse-width modulation (PWM) to optimize water usage. By precisely controlling pump operations, the system ensures efficient water utilization while maintaining collection capacity during rainfall events.

### System Highlights
* **555 timer-based PWM control**: Precision pump speed regulation
* **Adaptive distribution**: Water flow based on collection levels
* **Energy-efficient operation**: 40-60% power reduction vs. constant-speed pumps
* **Low-cost implementation**: Uses readily available components
* **Scalable design**: Suitable for residential to community applications

## Technical Specifications

### Hardware Components
